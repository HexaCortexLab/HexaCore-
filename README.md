# 🛠️ HexaCore: Multi-Layer Blockchain Risk Detection

## 🌐 Overview

**HexaCore** is an AI-powered platform for detecting blockchain risks in real time.  
By analyzing token behavior, volatility, and transaction patterns, HexaCore provides dynamic insights to help users interact with on-chain ecosystems more safely and intelligently.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🔐 CoreGuard  
Analyzes transaction-level data using token age, liquidity pressure, and behavioral intensity to detect foundational risk patterns.

### 🧬 HexTrack  
Maps multi-layered anomalies by combining signals from price fluctuation, volume spikes, and liquidity instability.

### 🔮 QuantumPulse  
Forecasts short-term volatility by correlating price movement with depth and velocity of market interactions.

### 🌐 QuantumShift  
Predicts major market shifts by tracking directional liquidity flows and trend reversals in token activity.

### 🔄 HexaSync  
Validates timestamp integrity to detect manipulation, sync errors, or blockchain-side latency issues.

## 🧠 AI Functionality

HexaCore’s intelligence is built from five modular AI engines — each tuned to detect risk, predict volatility, and interpret market flow in real time.  
These modules work together to transform raw blockchain noise into layered, actionable intelligence.

### 🔐 1. CoreGuard — AI Risk Perception Engine

```python
def core_guard(transaction):
    risk_threshold = 0.8
    token_risk = (transaction["amount"] / transaction["volume"]) * (transaction["token_age"] ** 0.5)
    liquidity_impact = transaction["frequency"] / transaction["total_volume"]
    
    total_risk = token_risk * liquidity_impact

    if total_risk > risk_threshold:
        return "Alert: High Core Risk Detected"
    else:
        return "Blockchain Core Secure"
```
#### What it does:
Evaluates core structural risk in transactions — combining token aging, liquidity impact, and behavioral intensity.
#### AI Insight: Uses threshold learning to adjust sensitivity based on shifting network behavior over time and across chains.

### 🧬 2. HexTrack — Multi-Layer Signal Mapping

```python
def hex_track(data):
    price_risk = abs(data["current_price"] - data["previous_price"]) / data["previous_price"]
    market_impact = data["token_volume"] / data["market_liquidity"]
    risk_index = price_risk * market_impact

    return "Alert: Multi-Layer Blockchain Risk Detected" if risk_index > 0.7 else "Blockchain Risk Normal"
```
#### What it does:
Scans multi-layered risks: price anomalies, volume bursts, and liquidity inconsistencies.
#### AI Insight: Connected to PatternNet, Hexa’s behavioral clustering model, exposing hidden asset-network relationships.

### 🔮 3. QuantumPulse — Volatility Foresight Engine

```js
function quantumPulse(marketData) {
  const volatilityFactor = marketData.priceChange / marketData.previousPrice;
  const marketDepth = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  const predictionScore = volatilityFactor * marketDepth;

  if (predictionScore > 1) {
    return 'Alert: High Blockchain Volatility Predicted';
  } else {
    return 'Market Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Forecasts future volatility by analyzing price motion and market depth.
#### AI Insight: Powered by LSTM-based forecasting models trained on historical crash patterns and token-specific liquidity behavior.

### 🌐 4. QuantumShift — Predictive Flow Dynamics

```js
function quantumShift(marketData) {
  const priceMovement = marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice;
  const marketFlow = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  const shiftPrediction = priceMovement * marketFlow;

  if (shiftPrediction > 500) {
    return 'Alert: Predictive Market Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Behavior Stable';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Predicts directional market shifts by tracking liquidity flow and price velocity.
#### AI Insight: Uses reinforcement-trained agents to detect repeatable trading behaviors across whales and bots — pinpointing upcoming trend reversals.

### 🔄 5. HexaSync — Chain-Time Synchronization Monitor

```python
from time import time

def hexa_sync(transaction):
    sync_deviation = abs(transaction["timestamp"] - time() * 1000)
    sync_threshold = 2000  # milliseconds
    return "Alert: Blockchain Sync Error" if sync_deviation > sync_threshold else "Blockchain Synchronized"
```
#### What it does:
Detects timestamp misalignments in blockchain data — revealing manipulations or faulty nodes.
#### AI Insight: Incorporates temporal anomaly detection to distinguish between natural network lag and malicious delay tactics in smart contracts.
